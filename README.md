if you use this extention to download the links and don't forget to remove the quotation marks from the front and back of the links.



step-2

open a python IDE and run the code.

instagram will detect robotic behaviour, to avoid this use a session id.
To get the session id :-
- Open the social network that you'd like to run our bot on
- Make sure to log into your account (we recommend creating a separate account for this purpose)
- Right click anywhere on the page and click 'Inspect'
- Click on the 'Application' tab
- Now select 'Cookies'
- Locate the cookie your are looking for (for example, for Instagram you will need the cookie called sessionid)
- Copy it and insert into the Bot's required form input
- You are done!



better to use this method for 250 links as after that instagram will detect robotic behaviour.

Don't over use as your acccount can come into instagram notice.
use a temporary account to stay on the safer side.
